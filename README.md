# QuickFlick

Objective: To create a simple movie database 
Technologies used: php, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, mysql

Abstract: 
- xampp was used for replicating a live server 
- php was primarily used to communicate with mysql database using PDO to avoid sql injections
- all javascript functions created for search bar and page component reload are inside js/main.js
- all sections commented heavily

Notes for testing this project: 
- use xampp
- data dump is inside narayan3.sql; upload this file to your phpmyadmin if you would like to see the website live

Needed Improvements:
- reduce redundancy in retrieving data from different types of users (ceo, employee, members)
- reduce redundancy in mysql database scheme, certain tables are not in 3NF 
- movies will not display/have holes in certain areas of the grid if title is too long
